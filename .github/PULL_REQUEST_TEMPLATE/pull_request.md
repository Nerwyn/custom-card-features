DO NOT DELETE THIS TEMPLATE.
Or at the very least make sure you include enough information so I know what you're adding.

**Checklist:**

- [ ] I've followed [the README contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Nerwyn/service-call-tile-feature/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and ensured that pre-commit and build ran correctly.
- [ ] I've done by best to ensure that my new code is stylistically similar to the rest of the project.
  - If it isn't too egregious the main developer will fix it in post.
- [ ] I've tested that my changes work on my Home Assistant instance, on different browsers and webviews in needed.
- [ ] I've ensured that my changes are not causing any new JavaScript errors in the browser console.
- [ ] I've updated the editor to include new fields for new features if needed.
  - The editor is a mess and the main developer open to working on these changes if needed, but the ability to modify all configuration fields via the editor is a requirement to release the changes.
- [ ] I've updated the README if needed.
